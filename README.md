# New York City Housing Market Analysis

## Introduction
Having spent my undergraduate years at New York University, I developed a deep interest in the dynamics of New York's housing prices. The challenge of finding reasonably priced and value-for-money housing in NYC is significant, given the myriad factors influencing prices. Throughout three years of renting apartments in the city, I've observed trends in the housing and rental market, noting the paramount importance of location and the roles of property size and type in determining price.

Despite these observations, a formal data analysis to systematically explore the factors affecting housing prices in New York was yet to be conducted. The [New York housing market dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/new-york-housing-market), comprising 4,801 properties and featuring 17 variables, provides a comprehensive overview of the real estate market in the area. This project aims to identify the primary factors influencing New York housing prices, focusing on:

- **Location-based analysis:** Uncover geographical patterns to identify areas with varying property prices.
- **Property type analysis:** Determine how different types of properties are valued in terms of price.
- **Property size analysis:** Examine the relationship between property size and price.

The NY housing market analysis provides quantitative insights into the housing options available in NYC, contributing to a broader understanding of the real estate market dynamics in New York, offering valuable information for potential buyers, sellers, and investors.

### Housing Type
- Condos, typically the most expensive, dominate the luxury segment.
- Co-ops tend to be more affordable, offering an accessible option for value seekers.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
This analysis provides valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and investors, highlighting the factors that influence the NYC housing market's pricing dynamics. 

Recommendations for prospective buyers include:

- **For the Affluent:** Large-sized condos in New York County are most appealing.

These suggestions aim to guide individuals through the NYC real estate market, aligning housing choices with financial capabilities and lifestyle preferences, and fostering a more inclusive and informed real estate environment.
